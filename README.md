# Java Full Stack Development Repository

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing Java Full Stack Development. It includes structured branches for different learning levels, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), projects, and a practice branch for experimentation.

## Branches
### Core (Beginner)
- Focus: Basic Java programs, syntax, and fundamental concepts.
- Includes topics like:
  - Variables, Data Types
  - Loops and Conditionals
  - Arrays and Strings
  - Functions and Recursion

### Intermediate
- Focus: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), basic frameworks, and APIs.
- Includes topics like:
  - OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, etc.)
  - File Handling
  - JDBC
  - Introduction to APIs

### Advanced
- Focus: Full-stack development frameworks and advanced Java concepts.
- Includes topics like:
  - Spring Boot
  - Hibernate and JPA
  - RESTful APIs
  - Microservices
  - Advanced debugging and optimization techniques

### Practice
- Focus: Mixed-level practice programs, coding challenges, and solutions.
- Includes:
  - Coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
  - Random experiments with Java code.

### Main
- The main branch is used for repository documentation, guides, and overall organization.

## Folder Structure
Each branch follows this folder structure:
```
/src
  └── core
      └── Beginner
      └── Intermediate
      └── Advanced
  /src/dsa
      └── easy
      └── medium
      └── hard
  /projects
  /docs
  /resources
```
